# GildedRoseApp

This is my attempt at the guilded rose kata

I currently only have access to a MacOS machine so modified the [.Net core version](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRoseCore)

The .net core version is out of date so i created a new project and brought over the two starter files.


[This is the minimum code needed to meet the client requirements](https://github.com/SSmale/GildedRoseApp/tree/v1)
